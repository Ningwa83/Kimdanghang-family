			 <p style="margin-left: 150px; font-size: 35px">Late Danta Bahadur Limbu belonged to the Kimdanghang family, present day rare clan. The clan used to reside at Bhirgaon, a hilly village in Dhankuta district of Eastern Nepal. During 19th and 20th century, they began to move down the hill to the flat terrain in a search for easier life. A few of them are found to be living at Puljhoda village of Morang district of Eastern Nepal while most of them are believed to have settled outside of Nepal. Kimdanghangs who claim to be Limbu caste at present day has stood on the edge of extinction while some of them call themselves Rai. Several historical events have to be considered to understand the causes. The most basic cause is the circumstances of being less in numbers in comparision to other castes like Rai in the region. The recent research by Marohang khawahang, PhD has proven that the clan's DNA matches with the Limbus. Click the link below to listen what he says.  </p>
